                    Welcome to NEOCOSMA, where I can create and showcase anything my heart desires. My name is Shakwan Williams, and I'm based in the Charlotte, North Carolina area. I was born and raised here and haven't traveled much yet, but I hope to change that in the future. In a nutshell, I'm an artist of various mediums. There's really no rhyme or reason to it. Computers have always been a part of my life, so it's only natural that my journey led me to computer graphics and digital arts. Professionally, I work in IT because I love it, and it gives me a way to channel all the extra stuff in my brain.
                    
                    I began my art journey traditionally, like most people, with paints, markers, and inks—you know the deal. I'd daydream about my various stories and fictional worlds while dealing with the harsh reality of a narcoleptic lifestyle. As my ambition grew, so did my tools, and my love for computers didn't hurt either. I convinced myself that I wanted to be a graphic designer, and I quickly learned some valuable lessons. After correcting my course, I began my IT career and decided to spend my remaining time awake exploring new creative avenues.
                    
                    Music was the first way I used a computer to express myself, even though I was initially introduced to it through orchestra and the cello. I haven't picked up a cello in years or received any formal music lessons since then—just playing what I like to hear. I love to conceptualize music for my future games and films, often getting lost in worldbuilding (narcolepsy has blessed me with a reliable creative vision). I imagine hardware setups with racks of equipment controlled by an Amiga or an old off-white computer, displaying all that numerical goodness on a glowing CRT screen. But honestly, I find myself working solely in the DAW nowadays. Ableton is my DAW of choice, and as soon as I "finish" my back catalog of work, I'd like to transition to Bitwig—just because it's native to Linux, and that's where I want to be. I'm tired of not being in control of my computer and having to shell out the cost of an entire new computer every time I want to install a fresh, supported, and stable version of the operating system. But I digress. I create under the name "Cadillac Warlock." I enjoy exploring different sonic frequencies and find myself producing many genres of music. My most recent music falls into the category of phonk, or better put, "UltraPhonk," a term coined by yours truly. All my work can be viewed on this page, on streaming services, and on my favorite platform, Bandcamp. Please take a look, support, or give feedback where possible. And if you have any questions about what you see on the site, feel free to shoot me an email. The information is listed on the Contact Page.
                    
                    When I use the computer to create visual art, I don't hesitate to exploit its capabilities. I automate steps in my creative process, use open-source software and communities, or sail the high seas in search of data (wink, wink). I am by no means an expert in these subjects and am just beginning my journey. However, I have a clear vision in my mind. With that being said, you will see various forms of digital artistic expression on this site, including the very site itself that I coded and hosted myself. My childhood was unfortunately full of strife, despite my wonderful mother's efforts. This instilled a flame of technical resilience and independence that still benefits me to this day. My drawings have evolved (or devolved, depending on one's perspective) into my infamous mouse drawings in the criminally underrated software MTPaint. Blender is where I create my low-poly PS1-esque style work, accompanied by GIMP and various other open-source/abandonware tools to create my artistic scenes. I strive to return to traditional art and hone my skills even further. I believe I'll do that when I get tired of staring at the pixels on these screens. Let me stop talking about it and let you all have a look for yourselves.
                    
                    Just some advice for struggling artists or other aspiring creatives: The worst version of an idea created will always be better than the best version of that idea still in your head.
