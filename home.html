                    NEOCOSMA is where I let my creativity run wild, bringing my ideas to life in digital and traditional mediums. Born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina, I've always had a deep connection to computers, naturally leading me to digital arts and IT. My artistic journey started with paint, markers, and ink, but as my ambitions grew, so did my tools. Music, especially conceptualizing soundtracks for future games and films, became another outlet, blending nostalgia with modern production techniques. Though I once imagined myself as a graphic designer, IT became my true calling, allowing me to channel my creativity while keeping my technical mind engaged. Under the alias "Cadillac Warlock," I explore a variety of sonic frequencies, recently diving into phonk—better yet, "UltraPhonk," my own take on the genre. My work is available here, on streaming services, and on my favorite platform, Bandcamp, where I welcome feedback and support.

                    When it comes to visual art, I embrace the power of computers, automating my creative process and relying on open-source software to push my ideas forward. My digital pieces span various styles, including low-poly, PS1-inspired aesthetics crafted in Blender, alongside my notorious mouse-drawn works using MTPaint. The site itself, coded and hosted by me, is a testament to my technical resilience—something ingrained from a childhood filled with challenges. Though I plan to return to traditional art at some point, for now, I'm immersed in pixels and screen glow. If there's one piece of advice I'd give to fellow artists and creatives, it's this: the worst version of an idea created will always be better than the best version still stuck in your head.
